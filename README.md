#The Idea
Currently when people go out to eat, menus can be cluttered with many opinions that might not relevant  to customer. Many times people would just rather see options that are relevant to them. For example, if some have diary issues, it  would be interesting if there was an  unobtrusive app that could show all the menu items that had products without milk.  People should be able to interact with the application when their  in the restaurant of interest.

#The Focus
As so called developers, we wanted focus on a several main points 
<ul>
	<li>A minimalistic and clean application</li>
	<li>Primary Mobile focus but secondary web base interface</li>
	<li>Unobtrusive design </li>
</ul>

#Development Techniques and Technologies 
There two main parts this project: the backend and app. The backend will be built using Node js. It will handle the calls between the clients app and retrieving relevant information from google location api and our own foods database. Mongo will be used as our database system. The client mobile application will be built using ionic. It will leverage the gps data to determine the restaurants in the location. Mysql lite library will be used to store information on the user preferences.
